This GitHub repository contains both the naive implentation (naiveAlgorithm.java) of the tweet replacer, and our custom faster algorithm (fasterAlgorithm.java). Also included in this repository is the document containing the abbreviated words and their associated full spelling (Slang.csv). The input data file (filtered_data.csv) was too large to upload to GitHub, however it can be downloaded on the COSC 320 canvas page.

To run both codes, Slang.csv and filtered_data.csv need to be downloaded to your device. The directories for the .csv files need to be edited in the code to match where the files are downloaded to your device. If the filtered_data.csv directory is incorrect, the program will alert you by saying "Cannot find input file!". If the Slang.csv directory is incorrect, the program will still run, however zero changes will be made.
